1. Clone

As previously mentioned, you should already have some exposure to the clone command, as you
(hopefully) used it to get this file in the first place.

If you haven't yet, open up a terminal and run the following command:
  git clone https://github.com/cole14/learningGit.git

The git clone command reaches out to the authoritative server and asks for the latest copy
in order to INITIALIZE the local copy.  This command should only be used to get the initial
copy of the repository on your local machine.  It will download all the files from the remote
server and place them in a new directory in the current working directory on your local machine
(in ./learningGit/ for this example).

After you've run the clone command, you'll want to periodically get the latest updates from
the authoritative version using the pull command.

Continue on to the 2_PULL file.
