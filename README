This is the Purdue ACM SIGART's introduction to git!  

By the end of this tutorial, you'll hopefully have a better understanding of how to use git.

To start, open the terminal and run:
    git clone https://github.com/cole14/learningGit.git

After running the above command, you should have a folder named 'learningGit' in the current
working directory.  To continue, open the file named 'BEGIN' and follow along.
